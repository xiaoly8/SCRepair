SCRepair
===

The first automated smart contract gas-optimized vulnerability repair system. SCRepair can automatically generate patches fixing vulnerabilities while attempt to keep the test cases passing.

Current implementation supports Slither and Oyente as vulnerability detector.

Installation
===

```Bash
python3 setup.py install
```

You might need to install the vulnerability detector of choice separately before our repair system can invoke.

To Use
===

Use the following command

```Bash
python3 CLI.py repair PATH_TO_CONTRACT
```

You also need to configure the detectors intended to be used via the `--detector` flag.
Besides, you may use `--targeted_vul` to only target subset of detected vulnerabilities.

As output, the paths to the plausible patches will be printed to the standard out.
